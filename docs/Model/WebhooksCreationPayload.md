**events** | **string[]** | A list of the webhooks that you are subscribing to. There are Currently four webhook options: * &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;video.encoding.quality.completed&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  When a new video is uploaded into your account, it will be encoded into several different HLS sizes/bitrates.  When each version is encoded, your webhook will get a notification.  It will look like &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;{ \\\&quot;type\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;video.encoding.quality.completed\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;emittedAt\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;2021-01-29T16:46:25.217+01:00\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;videoId\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;viXXXXXXXX\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;encoding\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;hls\\\&quot;, \\\&quot;quality\\\&quot;: \\\&quot;720p\\\&quot;} &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;. This request says that the 720p HLS encoding was completed. * &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;live-stream.broadcast.started&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  When a livestream begins broadcasting, the broadcasting parameter changes from false to true, and this webhook fires. * &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;live-stream.broadcast.ended&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  This event fores when the livestream has finished broadcasting, and the broadcasting parameter flips from false to true. * &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;video.source.recorded&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  This event is similar to &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;video.encoding.quality.completed&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;, but tells you if a livestream has been recorded as a VOD. |
**url** | **string** | The the url to which HTTP notifications are sent. It could be any http or https URL. |
