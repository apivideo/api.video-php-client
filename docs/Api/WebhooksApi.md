Method | Description | HTTP request
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**create()**](WebhooksApi.md#create) | Create Webhook | **POST** `/webhooks`

## **`create()` - Create Webhook**



Webhooks can push notifications to your server, rather than polling api.video for changes. We currently offer four events: 

* ```video.encoding.quality.completed``` Occurs when a new video is uploaded into your account, it will be encoded into several different HLS and mp4 qualities. When each version is encoded, your webhook will get a notification.  It will look like ```{ "type": "video.encoding.quality.completed", "emittedAt": "2021-01-29T16:46:25.217+01:00", "videoId": "viXXXXXXXX", "encoding": "hls", "quality": "720p"} ```. This request says that the 720p HLS encoding was completed.

* ```live-stream.broadcast.started```  When a live stream begins broadcasting, the broadcasting parameter changes from false to true, and this webhook fires.

* ```live-stream.broadcast.ended```  This event fires when a live stream has finished broadcasting.

* ```video.source.recorded```  This event occurs when a live stream is recorded and submitted for encoding.
